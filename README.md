# gcbiasr

This package is a convenience wrapper around some functions I've developped to
analyse the sequencing data of the conversion tracts of *Acinetobacter*. The
data in `data/` are the raw data parsed by `read_phruscle`. 

See
[here](http://sam217pa.github.io/gbc-seq_mars/anl/phruscle_call/phruscle_call.html)
for examples of its use.
